    description: "The SEAT Ateca marks the Spanish brand's first entry into the compact SUV segment, strategically launched to capitalize on the growing demand for crossovers in European markets. Named after a village in Spain, the Ateca is built on the Volkswagen Group's MQB platform shared with vehicles like the Volkswagen Tiguan and Škoda Karoq. Measuring approximately 4.36 meters in length, the Ateca combines compact exterior dimensions with a spacious interior offering 510 liters of cargo capacity (485 liters in all-wheel drive variants). The exterior design features SEAT's sharp, angular styling language with triangular headlights, a prominent grille, and sculpted body panels creating a more dynamic appearance than many competitors. Engine options at launch included 1.0 TSI and 1.4 TSI (later replaced by 1.5 TSI) gasoline engines and 1.6 TDI and 2.0 TDI diesel variants with power outputs ranging from 115 to 190 horsepower. Transmission options include six-speed manual and seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic, with 4Drive all-wheel drive available on selected higher-powered models. The interior features a driver-oriented dashboard with an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system (later upgraded to 9.2 inches with the facelift), available digital cockpit, and practical storage solutions. A mid-cycle refresh in 2020 brought updated exterior styling with new LED headlights, a revised grille design, and updated bumpers, while the interior received improved technology including enhanced connectivity features and driver assistance systems. The sporty CUPRA Ateca, introduced in 2018 and later spun off into the separate CUPRA performance brand, features a 2.0 TSI engine producing 300 horsepower, all-wheel drive, and distinctive styling elements. The Ateca has become one of SEAT's most successful models, praised for combining practicality with engaging driving dynamics—a relative rarity in the compact SUV segment—while offering competitive pricing compared to many rivals."
