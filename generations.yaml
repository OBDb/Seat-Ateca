    description: "The SEAT Ateca marks the Spanish brand's first entry into the compact SUV segment, strategically launched to capitalize on the growing demand for crossovers in European markets. Named after a village in Spain, the Ateca is built on the Volkswagen Group's MQB A1 platform shared with vehicles like the Volkswagen Tiguan and Škoda Karoq. Measuring approximately 4.36 meters in length, the Ateca combines compact exterior dimensions with a spacious interior offering 510 liters of cargo capacity (485 liters in all-wheel drive variants). The exterior design features SEAT's sharp, angular styling language with triangular headlights, a prominent grille, and sculpted body panels creating a more dynamic appearance than many competitors. Engine options at launch included 1.0 TSI and 1.4 TSI (later replaced by 1.5 TSI) gasoline engines and 1.6 TDI and 2.0 TDI diesel variants with power outputs ranging from 115 to 190 horsepower. Transmission options include six-speed manual and seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic, with 4Drive all-wheel drive available on selected higher-powered models. The interior features a driver-oriented dashboard with an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, available digital cockpit, and practical storage solutions. The pre-facelift model was awarded 5 stars by Euro NCAP in 2016 for safety."

    description: "The facelifted SEAT Ateca was revealed in June 2020, bringing significant visual and technological updates while maintaining the MQB A1 platform. Exterior revisions include a modified front bumper, a new rear bumper, a revised radiator grille, new LED headlamps and tail lights with sequential indicators on higher trim levels. The traditional block-capital SEAT badge was replaced with the new hand-written script logo. Interior updates include a new leather steering wheel, updated door cards, new upholstery designs, an eight-way electrically adjustable driver's seat, USB-C ports, and a multi-colour ambient lighting system. The infotainment system was upgraded to an 8.25-inch unit as standard with a larger 9.2-inch unit as an option. The model range continues to include the Xcellence, FR, and entry-level trims, with the performance-oriented Cupra Ateca also receiving corresponding updates featuring the copper-tinted Cupra badge and a 2.0 TSI engine producing 300 horsepower."
